Welcome to monad-bayes's documentation!
=======================================

Monad-bayes is a library for doing probabilistic programming in Haskell, using probability monads. The emphasis is on composition of inference algorithms implemented in terms of monad transformers.

This documentation is for:

* **users**: to understand how to write probabilistic programs and run inference methods
* **developers**: to understand how the inference methods work and how to extend them
